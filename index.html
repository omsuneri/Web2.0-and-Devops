         <p>For the address of a person we uses another tag known as <b>address.</b>
        <address>Vill- Shekhpuri, Laksar <br>
            District- Haridwar,
            <br> Uttarakhand
        </address></p>
        <p>The cite tag used to denote the name of a book , pen , song, movie , painting, sculpture, etc. but not the name of the person. Also it renders in <cite> italic </cite>. </p>
